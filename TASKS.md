# Implementation Plan to Align with ARCHITECTURE.md

## 1. Database Layer Updates
- [ ] Create migration script to rename `file_id` to `file_status_id` in `obsidian_documents`
- [ ] Update all code references to use new column name
- [ ] Add foreign key constraint between `obsidian_documents` and `obsidian_file_status`
- [ ] Update SQL queries to use proper join conditions
- [ ] Test data integrity after migration

## 2. Atomic Operations Implementation
- [ ] Audit all database operations for atomicity
- [ ] Implement proper transaction blocks for:
  - File status updates
  - Document content updates
  - Combined operations
- [ ] Add rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- [ ] Ensure file status and document operations are atomic
- [ ] Add validation checks for atomic operations

## 3. Event Queue Processing
- [ ] Review QueueService implementation
- [ ] Implement strict single-threaded processing
- [ ] Add event persistence mechanism
- [ ] Implement proper event ordering
- [ ] Add queue state tracking
- [ ] Add queue recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Test queue behavior under various scenarios

## 4. File Status vs Document Content Separation
- [ ] Audit all file operations
- [ ] Separate file status updates from content updates
- [ ] Ensure file status is updated before content
- [ ] Add validation for file status existence
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup of orphaned records
- [ ] Test separation of concerns

## 5. Obsidian Integration Optimization
- [ ] Review event handling implementation
- [ ] Optimize file system operations
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup procedures
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Test integration with Obsidian's features
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with Obsidian updates

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add state recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Add error reporting mechanisms
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery

## 7. State Consistency
- [ ] Implement proper state tracking
- [ ] Add validation checks for state consistency
- [ ] Ensure consistent state across operations
- [ ] Add recovery mechanisms for inconsistent states
- [ ] Test state management under various conditions

## 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Review file operations for optimization
- [ ] Implement batch processing where possible
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize database queries
- [ ] Test with large vaults
- [ ] Implement cleanup procedures

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for atomic operations
- [ ] Integration tests for queue processing
- [ ] Performance tests with large vaults
- [ ] Error scenario tests
- [ ] Recovery procedure tests
- [ ] State consistency tests

## Notes
- All changes must maintain backward compatibility
- Each phase should be tested thoroughly before proceeding
- Documentation should be updated as changes are made
- Performance metrics should be collected before and after changes
- Error handling should be comprehensive and well-documented
