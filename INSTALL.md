## For Developers

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v14 or higher)

The inspiration for this plugin came from watching Nate Herk's YouTube video [Step by Step: RAG AI Agents Got Even Better](https://youtu.be/wEXrbtqNIqI?t=323). This is great to watch to setup your Telegram Chatbot using n8n to connect to the Supabase database. I made an "Obsidian" workflow which I can plug into other n8n workflows to get information from my Obsidian vault in different scenarios. It has made retrieving knowledge from my vault so much easier and more practical in different use cases.

     ```
     SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
     SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
     ```

4. **Initialize the project**

### Troubleshooting

#### Database Connection Issues

If you encounter database connection issues:

1. **Check IP Address Restrictions**
   - Run `make test-db` to see your current IP address
   - Add this IP to your Supabase project's network restrictions
   - Wait a few minutes for changes to take effect

2. **Verify Connection Details**
   - Ensure your `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` are correct
   - Check if the project reference matches your Supabase dashboard
   - Verify there are no network restrictions or firewall rules blocking the connection

3. **Install Required Tools**
   If you see errors about missing commands:
   - `psql`: Install PostgreSQL with `make install-postgres`
   - `jq`: Install with `brew install jq`
   - `timeout`: Install with `brew install coreutils`

#### Release Issues

If you encounter issues during release:

1. **Working Directory Not Clean**
   - Commit or stash any changes before running release commands
   - Use `git status` to check for uncommitted changes

2. **Not on Main Branch**
   - Switch to the main branch with `git checkout main`
   - Ensure all changes are merged before releasing

3. **Version Bump Issues**
